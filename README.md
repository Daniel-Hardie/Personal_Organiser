# Personal_Organiser

## Description
This app uses the Ionic framework and is a simple personal organiser app. The end goal is for the app to contain a calendar and note 
taking functionality, as well as users able to sign up and log in. The app also has Firebase Integration to store data.  

The reason I am creating this app is to gain experience in Angular.JS, HTMl and CSS as my experience is limited. I am hoping this project will give me these missing experiences and set me on a path to better understanding web development.

## How to Run
Ensure that the latest version of Ionic is installed on your device. If so, navigate to this project and enter the command "ionic serve"
for it to run in your web browser locally.

## Known Bugs
* When new user is created their UID is no longer added to database in Firebase
* Upon executing Ionic serve for first time, might not take to home page. If so log out and thne log in for now.
